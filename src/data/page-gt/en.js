    'No you don’t need to keep the app running. After the Mode is selected you can close the app ',

  'pageGT.faq2header': 'What is the 120 miles adjustment period?',
  'pageGT.faq2content':
    'The adjustment of 120 miles is necessary to make sure the tune is applied safely and chip has collected enough data to create a perfectly balanced tune. You may not feel the performance improvements if the adjustment is not complete.',

  'pageGT.faq3header': 'Does it have to stayed plugged in all the time?',
  'pageGT.faq3content':
    'Our car performance tuner can: add 10-20% hp and torque to your vehicle or boost fuel saving in MPG by up to 10-15%; create sportier feel and make the faster AT transmission shifting. Please Note There are many contributing factors that might affect the performance increase such as aspiration, fuel quality, altitude and engine displacement. For the best experience it is important to read the instruction manual and drive 120 miles to adjust the tune preporly, You can learn more about the adjustment process here.',

  'pageGT.faq4header':
    'Do I need to drive 120 miles every time I switch the mode?',
  'pageGT.faq4content':
    'Yes. Each mode is a separate tuning setting that requires an adjustment. It is impossible to use only one tuning setting and turn it up and down like a volume control for more power or less power. This is why we need 6 separate tuning settings. They all require a separate adjustment cycle to be fully applied.',

  'pageGT.faq5header': 'Will it void my warranty? ',
  'pageGT.faq5content':
    'No, the tuning method we use ensures the original ECU software is unchaged and you can always reverse the tuning at your convinience. ',

  'pageGT.faq6header': 'Why 120 miles adjustment is required?',
  'pageGT.faq6content':
    'It only changes the ECUs calculated fuel delivery and timing values stored in the temporary memory of the ECU at up to 256 load points and since it is altering the temporary memory (RAM) and not changing the permanent memory (ROM) the adjustment of 120 miles required.',
  'pageGT.faq7header': 'What parametrs does the GT changes on my vehicle?',
  'pageGT.faq7content':
    'It only changes the ECUs calculated fuel delivery and timing values (ignition timing advanced) stored in the temporary memory of the ECU at up to 256 load points. It wont change the boost pressure or any other viriables.',
